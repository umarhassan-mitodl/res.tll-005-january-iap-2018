## Professor Winston’s Courses on OCW

Professor Winston was widely known for teaching [*6.034 Artificial Intelligence*](/courses/6-034-artificial-intelligence-fall-2010), a class that introduced students to the basic knowledge representation, problem solving, and learning methods of artificial intelligence.

Another course long taught by Professor Winston was [*6.803 The Human Intelligence Enterprise*](/courses/6-803-the-human-intelligence-enterprise-spring-2019)*,* which was designed to help students learn about progress toward the scientific goal of understanding human intelligence from a computational point of view.

## The Greatest Computing Innovation

Patrick gave [his last public talk](https://youtu.be/vCyZUiBr_ds?t=1929) at the launch event for the MIT Stephen A. Schwarzman College of Computing on Feb. 26, 2019. “What is the greatest computing innovation of all time?” he asked. His answer: “It’s us.”

## Profiles and Tributes

[*Open with a Promise, Close with a Joke*](https://www.ocw-openmatters.org/2016/07/19/open-with-a-promise-close-with-a-joke/) describes some of the teaching techniques Professor Winston used in his artificial intelligence course and elsewhere.

The [obituary for Professor Winston](http://thetech.com/2019/07/23/professor-patrick-winston-obit) in the student newspaper *The Tech* touches on some wonderful and heartfelt tributes, including this from Richard Yip ’17, a former TA for 6.034: “His classes were never just about artificial intelligence. He taught his students how to think, how to act, and how to lead a worthy, fulfilling life.”
